# ðŸ“ƒ About

This API, developed using FastAPI as a web framework for building APIs in Python, emerged in response to the need to access information from a database and generate corresponding reports.

> ***The project was initiated to serve freelance objectives.***

The documentation for this project is not entirely open to the public; that's why you won't find information on endpoints and other details.
